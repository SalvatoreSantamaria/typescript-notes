Describe data: make sure all objects have shapes

Use enums

Use interfaces

Extend interfaces
Extending interfaces reduces duplication, because you don't have to copy the properties between interfaces. Also, the reader of your code can easily understand the relationships in your application.

Use destructuring on properties
const { objname, scope } = object;

Naming
Use camelCase for variable and function names.
Use PascalCase for class names and interface names.
Use camelCase for interface members.
Use PascalCase for type names and enum names.
Name files with camelCase (for example, ebsVolumes.tsx or storage.tsb)

Require should not be used except in imports
